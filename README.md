# Iris-Flower-Classification
The objective of this project is to build a robust real-time classification system for predicting Iris flower species using both traditional machine learning and deep learning models. It aims to identify the most accurate model, save it, and deploy it through an interactive Dash-based dashboard for dynamic predictions.
